        <h1>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>

        <p>It is LIV3's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our
            website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://liv3.nz">https://liv3.nz</a> (hereinafter, "us",
            "we", or "https://liv3.nz"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable
            information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy")
            to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what
            circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to
            information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other
            sources.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general
            rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our
            Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

        <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
        <p>Like most website operators, LIV3 collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
            browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
            site, and the date and time of each visitor request. LIV3's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
            information is to better understand how LIV3's visitors use its website. From time to time, LIV3 may release
            non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage
            of its website.</p>
        <p>LIV3 also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for
            logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://liv3.nz blog posts. LIV3 only discloses logged in
            user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
            personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

        <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>Certain visitors to LIV3's websites choose to interact with LIV3 in ways that require LIV3 to gather
            personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that LIV3 gathers depends on the
            nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://liv3.nz to provide
            a username and email address.</p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission
            over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
            acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party
            link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy
            and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
        <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any
            third party sites, products or services.</p>
        <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

            LIV3's sole discretion. LIV3 encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its
            Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your
            acceptance of such change.</p>
